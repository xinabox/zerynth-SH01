XinaBox SH01
=============

This xChip is based on the CAP1296 which is a multiple channel capacitive touch sensor controller. Each sensor input is calibrated to compensate for system parasitic capacitance and automatically recalibrated to compensate for gradual environmental changes. In addition, the CAP1296 can be configured to detect proximity on one or more channels with an optional signal guard to reduce noise sensitivity. The CAP1296 includes Multiple Pattern Touch recognition that allows the user to select a specific set of buttons to be touched simultaneously. If this pattern is detected, a status bit is set and an interrupt is generated.
